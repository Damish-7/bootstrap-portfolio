Quick start 
Get started by including Bootstrap’s production-ready CSS and JavaScript via CDN without the need for any build steps. See it in practice with this Bootstrap CodePen demo.


Create a new index.html file in your project root. Include the <meta name="viewport"> tag as well for proper responsive behavior in mobile devices.


<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Bootstrap demo</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
Include Bootstrap’s CSS and JS. Place the <link> tag in the <head> for our CSS, and the <script> tag for our JavaScript bundle (including Popper for positioning dropdowns, popovers, and tooltips) before the closing </body>. Learn more about our CDN links.


<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Bootstrap demo</title>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.8/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-sRIl4kxILFvY47J16cr9ZwB07vP4J8+LH7qKQnuqkuIAvNWLzeN8tE5YBujZqJLB" crossorigin="anonymous">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.8/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-FKyoEForCGlyvwx9Hj09JcYn3nv7wiPVlz7YYwJrWVcXK/BmnVDxM+D2scQbITxI" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  </body>
</html>
You can also include Popper and our JS separately. If you don’t plan to use dropdowns, popovers, or tooltips, save some kilobytes by not including Popper.


<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.11.8/dist/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-I7E8VVD/ismYTF4hNIPjVp/Zjvgyol6VFvRkX/vR+Vc4jQkC+hVqc2pM8ODewa9r" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.8/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-G/EV+4j2dNv+tEPo3++6LCgdCROaejBqfUeNjuKAiuXbjrxilcCdDz6ZAVfHWe1Y" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
Hello, world! Open the page in your browser of choice to see your Bootstrapped page. Now you can start building with Bootstrap by creating your own layout, adding dozens of components, and utilizing our official examples.

CDN links 
As reference, here are our primary CDN links.

Description	URL
CSS	https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.8/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
JS	https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.8/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js
You can also use the CDN to fetch any of our additional builds listed in the Contents page.

When using CDN links, be sure to use the integrity attribute to verify the correct files and versions. These hashes are unique to each file and version of Bootstrap, so when you update to a new version, be sure the integrity attribute is also updated.

We also include a crossorigin="anonymous" attribute to prevent CORS errors.
